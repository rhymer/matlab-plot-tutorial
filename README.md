# Matlab Graphics
This is an introduction to Matlab graphics.
After reading this tutorial, you will be able to create the plot like

![step](/fig/Add_Lines_to_Plot_1_01.png)

This tutorial covers the most frequently used 2D and 3D plotting functions.
Advanced topics such as fine-tunning the appearance of the figure using commands and animation are also covered.

This material is prepared by me when I was one of the lecturer of the UCLA HSSEAS Matlab Workshop from 2012 to 2013.
HSSEAS no longer holds this Matlab Workshop because it will be offered as a course.
